<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zurkon/repo-assets/main/space-shooter/pathPrefab.png" width="200">

This was made specially for practices some concepts:
- [Object Pooling](https://www.raywenderlich.com/847-object-pooling-in-unity)
- [Singleton Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
- [Bezier Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYccz1Ha34) for enemies pathing

At some point of development, like creating Enemies Pathing, i made a `Enemy Path Editor` inside `Path's Prefab` for produtivity.
